# Modal Python Library

The Modal Python Library provides convenient, on-demand access to serverless
cloud compute from Python scripts on your local computer.

## Documentation

See the [Modal documentation](http://modal.com/docs) for Python, with examples
of how to use the library. You need a Modal account to use this library. **We
are currently in private beta**, and you can get a beta testing invite at
[modal.com](https://modal.com).

## Installation

This requires Python 3.7 or later. Install the package with:

```bash
pip install modal-client
```
