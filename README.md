# Modal Python Library

The Modal Python Library provides convenient, on-demand access to serverless
cloud compute from Python scripts on your local computer.

## Documentation

See the [Modal documentation](http://modal.com/docs) for Python, with examples
of how to use the library.

## Installation

This requires Python 3.7 or later. Install the package with:

Then, you can create a Modal account (or link your existing one) directly on the
command line.

```bash
python3 -m modal setup
```
