# Rules files for LLMs

Can be symlinked or imported into your LLM coding system of choice, e.g.:

- **Claude Code**: Include the main repo rules by adding `@.llm-rules/modal-client-main.mdc` to your `CLAUDE.md` file.
- **Cursor**: Cursor does not seem to support inclusion (as of 2025-06-24), so you can e.g. symlink it into the `.cursor/rules` directory.
