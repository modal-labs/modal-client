# Changelog

This changelog documents user-facing updates (features, enhancements, fixes, and deprecations) to the `modal` client library. Patch releases are made on every change.

The client library is still in pre-1.0 development, and sometimes breaking changes are necessary. We try to minimize them and publish deprecation warnings / migration guides in advance, typically providing a transition window of several months.

We appreciate your patience while we speedily work towards a stable release of the client.
