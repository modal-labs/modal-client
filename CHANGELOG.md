# Changelog

This changelog documents user-facing updates (features, enhancements, fixes, and deprecations) to the `modal` client library. Patch releases are made on every change.

The client library is still in pre-1.0 development, and sometimes breaking changes are necessary. We try to minimize them and publish deprecation warnings / migration guides in advance, typically providing a transition window of several months.

We appreciate your patience while we speedily work towards a stable release of the client.

## Latest

<!-- NEW CONTENT GENERATED BELOW. PLEASE PRESERVE THIS COMMENT. -->

### 0.58.75 (2024-02-23)

* Function calls can now be cancelled without killing the container running the inputs. This allows new inputs by different function calls to the same function to be picked up immediately without having to cold-start new containers after cancelling calls.



### 0.57.62 (2024-02-21)

- An `InvalidError` is now raised when a lifecycle decorator (`@build`, `@enter`, or `@exit`) is used in conjunction with `@method`. Previously, this was undefined and could produce confusing failures.



### 0.57.61 (2024-02-21)

- Reduced the amount of context for frames in modal's CLI framework when showing a traceback.



### 0.57.60 (2024-02-21)

- The "dunder method" approach for class lifecycle management (`__build__`, `__enter__`, `__exit__`, etc.) is now deprecated in favor of the modal `@build`, `@enter`, and `@exit` decorators.



### 0.57.52 (2024-02-17)

- In `modal token new` and `modal token set`, the `--no-no-verify` flag has been removed in favor of a `--verify` flag. This remains the default behavior.



### 0.57.51 (2024-02-17)

- Fixes a regression from 0.57.40 where `@enter` methods used a separate event loop.



### 0.57.42 (2024-02-14)

- Adds a new environment variable/config setting, `MODAL_FORCE_BUILD`/`force_build`, that coerces all images to be built from scratch, rather than loaded from cache.



### 0.57.40 (2024-02-13)

- The `@enter()` lifecycle method can now be used to run additional setup code prior to function checkpointing (when the class is decorated with `stub.cls(enable_checkpointing=True)`. Note that there are currently some limitations on function checkpointing:
  - Checkpointing only works for CPU memory; any GPUs attached to the function will not available
  - Networking is disabled while the checkpoint is being created
- Please note that function checkpointing is still a beta feature.



### 0.57.31 (2024-02-12)

- Fixed an issue with displaying deprecation warnings on Windows systems.



### 0.57.22 (2024-02-09)

- Modal client deprecation warnings are now highlighted in the CLI



### 0.57.16 (2024-02-07)

- Fixes a regression in container scheduling. Users on affected versions (**0.57.5**â€”**0.57.15**) are encouraged to upgrade immediately.



### 0.57.15 (2024-02-07)

- The legacy `image_python_version` config option has been removed. Use the `python_version=` parameter on your image definition instead.



### 0.57.13 (2024-02-07)

- Adds support for mounting an S3 bucket as a volume.



### 0.57.9 (2024-02-07)

- Support for an implicit 'default' profile is now deprecated. If you have more than one profile in your Modal config file, one must be explicitly set to `active` (use `modal profile activate` or edit your `.modal.toml` file to resolve).
- An error is now raised when more than one profile is set to `active`.



### 0.57.2 (2024-02-06)

- Improve error message when generator functions are called with `.map(...)`.



### 0.57.0 (2024-02-06)

- Greatly improved streaming performance of generators and WebSocket web endpoints.
- **Breaking change:** You cannot use `.map()` to call a generator function. (In previous versions, this merged the results onto a single stream, but the behavior was undocumented and not widely used.)
- **Incompatibility:** Generator outputs are now on a different internal system. Modal code on client versions before 0.57 cannot trigger [deployed functions](https://modal.com/docs/guide/trigger-deployed-functions) with `.remote_gen()` that are on client version 0.57, and vice versa.



## 0.56

Note that in version 0.56 and prior, Modal used a different numbering system for patch releases.


### 0.56.4964 (2024-02-05)

- When using `modal token new` or `model token set`, the profile containing the new token will now be activated by default. Use the `--no-activate` switch to update the `modal.toml` file without activating the corresponding profile.



### 0.56.4953 (2024-02-05)

- The `modal profile list` output now indicates when the workspace is determined by a token stored in environment variables.



### 0.56.4952 (2024-02-05)

- Variadic parameters (e.g. *args and **kwargs) can now be used in scheduled functions as long as the function doesn't have any other parameters without a default value



### 0.56.4903 (2024-02-01)

- `modal container exec`'s `--no-tty` flag has been renamed to `--no-pty`.



### 0.56.4902 (2024-02-01)

- The singular form of the `secret` parameter in `Stub.function`, `Stub.cls`, and `Image.run_function` has been deprecated. Please update your code to use the plural form instead:`secrets=[Secret(...)]`.



### 0.56.4885 (2024-02-01)

- In `modal profile list`, the user's GitHub username is now shown as the name for the "Personal" workspace.



### 0.56.4874 (2024-01-31)

- The `modal token new` and `modal token set` commands now create profiles that are more closely associated with workspaces, and they have more explicit profile activation behavior:
  - By default, these commands will create/update a profile named after the workspace that the token points to, rather than a profile named "default"
  - Both commands now have an `--activate` flag that will activate the profile associated with the new token
  - If no other profiles exist at the time of creation, the new profile will have its `active` metadata set to True
- With these changes, we are moving away from the concept of a "default" profile. Implicit usage of the "default" profile will be deprecated in a future update.



### 0.56.4849 (2024-01-29)

- Adds tty support to `modal container exec` for fully-interactive commands. Example: `modal container exec [container-id] /bin/bash`



### 0.56.4792 (2024-01-26)

- The `modal profile list` command now shows the workspace associated with each profile.



### 0.56.4715 (2024-01-24)

- `Mount.from_local_python_packages` now places mounted packages at `/root` in the Modal runtime by default (used to be `/pkg`). To override this behavior, the function now takes a `remote_dir: Union[str, PurePosixPath]` argument.



### 0.56.4707 (2024-01-23)

- The Modal client library is now compatible with Python 3.12, although there are a few limitations:

  - Images that use Python 3.12 without explicitly specifing it through `python_version` or `add_python` will not build
    properly unless the modal client is also running on Python 3.12.
  - The `conda` and `microconda` base images currently do not support Python 3.12 because an upstream dependency is not yet compatible.



### 0.56.4700 (2024-01-22)

- `gpu.A100` class now supports specifying GiB memory configuration using a `size: str` parameter. The `memory: int` parameter is deprecated.



### 0.56.4693 (2024-01-22)

- You can now execute commands in running containers with `modal container exec [container-id] [command]`.



### 0.56.4691 (2024-01-22)

- The `modal` cli now works more like the `python` cli in regard to script/module loading:
  - Running `modal my_dir/my_script.py` now puts `my_dir` on the PYTHONPATH.
  - `modal my_package.my_module` will now mount to /root/my_package/my_module.py in your Modal container, regardless if using automounting or not (and any intermediary `__init__.py` files will also be mounted)



### 0.56.4687 (2024-01-20)

- Modal now uses the current profile if `MODAL_PROFILE` is set to the empty string.



### 0.56.4649 (2024-01-17)

- Dropped support for building Python 3.7 based `modal.Image`s. Python 3.7 is end-of-life since late June 2023.



### 0.56.4620 (2024-01-16)

- modal.Stub.function now takes a `block_network` argument.



### 0.56.4616 (2024-01-16)

- modal.Stub now takes a `volumes` argument for setting the default volumes of all the stub's functions, similarly to the `mounts` and `secrets` argument.



### 0.56.4590 (2024-01-13)

- `modal serve`: Setting MODAL_LOGLEVEL=DEBUG now displays which files cause an app reload during serve



### 0.56.4570 (2024-01-12)

- `modal run` cli command now properly propagates `--env` values to object lookups in global scope of user code
