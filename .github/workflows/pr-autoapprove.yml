# Auto-approve hotfix pull requests.
#
# SOC-2 requires that all Github pull requests have 1 independent approval.
#
# > SOC 2 CM-03
# > System changes are approved by at least 1 independent person prior to deployment into production.
#
# We don't want hotfixes blocked on approval because they're 'emergency' changes,
# so we use this script and a Github Actions workflow (.github/workflows/pr_autoapprove.yml)
# to ensure hotfixes are immediately approved.
